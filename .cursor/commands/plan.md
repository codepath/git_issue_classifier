# Plan

Reference the relevant design document, and create or update a doc in the `milestones` directory, following the naming convention: `001_milestones.md`.

Create a series of milestones. The design should be built in an iterative, progressive way, so that we can verify and test along the way.

Each milestone should be relatively small and simple, so that I am able to more easily audit the implementation and debug issues. Each milestone should be designed to be easily verifiable via a manual test.

Create checkboxes like `[ ]`, so we can track completion.
