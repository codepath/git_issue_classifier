# Implement

For the indicated milestones, ask any clarifying questions. If relevant, review different implementation choices with pros and cons.

Make a list of a few pytests to add. We want to aim for simplicity, so the test coverage should be basic, not comprehensive.

Then, implement the milestone, and run the tests. Where relevant, include manual verification instructions for a final integration test.
